Homework: Write a program that starts two threads writing into the same text
file. The threads should be each reading book records from the command line and
populating the text file with these records. Have each thread accumulate the record
entries from the command line into an array of strings. This should be the threadspecific
data. Both threads should independently update this array of strings with
their input. By using thread-specific data, the final array of strings should be
consistent and should contain complete entries from both threads. For bonus: Have
the data entry accept as many command line entries as issued until an EOF
character is encountered. Implement this as a signal.
