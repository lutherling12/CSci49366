Homework: Write a user daemon that outputs the current time every 10 seconds
into a log file at the same level with the source code for the daemon in the directory
hierarchy. Have the configuration file redirect the log file to this place. Then change
the configuration file to output elsewhere. Send the daemon a signal telling it that
the configuration file was changed, forcing it to reread it and start sending the log
messages at the new location.
